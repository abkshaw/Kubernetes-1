# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apurvabhandari/kubernetes/master/exam_prep/kubernetes-cka-logo.png)<br>
- In the Kubernetes certifications (CKAD/CKA) it's important to be fast.<br>
- Before appearing to the exam please go and check out the Latest Kubernetes API version. Exam is based on the latest Kuberntes version only.<br>
- Some of the commands may be deprecated for the latest version and if you try those commands in exam then it will be a big chaos.<br>
- I am writing this blog on the latest version of Kubernetes v1.18 - Kindly ref to [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io) before your exam.<br>
- For CKA you have enough time to solve all 24 questions in 3hrs so no need to alias for even kubectl=k or kubectl get po=kgpo
- For kubernetes cluster installation of master and worker nodes - Do not go for KTHW (Kubernetes The Hard Way). It is clearly mentioned that install clusters with kubeadm only. So be handy only with kubeadm and kubeadm flags and options.
- Before the exam please just ask the experienced one who appeared for the exam recently.
- I found that bash autocompletion for commands were missing for both root and non-root terminal. Refer [This](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#bash)<br>
