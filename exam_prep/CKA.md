# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
- In the Kubernetes certifications (CKAD/CKA) it's important to be fast.<br>
- Before appearing to the exam please go and check out the Latest Kubernetes API version. Exam is based on the latest Kuberntes version only.<br>
- Some of the commands may be deprecated for the latest version and if you try those commands in exam then it will be a big chaos.<br>
- I am writing this blog on the latest version of Kubernetes v1.18 - Kindly ref to [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io) <br>
